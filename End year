All my tasks continue to be supported by proper controls to minimize risks, including detailed logs that allow me to verify whether cases were created correctly and prevent potential errors. I maintain constant communication with the Operations team, who promptly notify me of any issues with merchants or CMs. This collaboration allows me to identify and address duplicate cases or other anomalies in a timely and effective manner.

In the second half of the year, I focused on ensuring business continuity as the ODL tables in our SQL environment are planned to be decommissioned. These tables are essential for providing data support to the Operations team. To mitigate the impact, I began developing new queries that extract information directly from the SOR tables, which are the main data sources feeding ODL. This proactive approach ensures that we can maintain the same level of service and data reliability once the ODL tables are retired.

Additionally, I have been working closely with my teammate to standardize the reports used by both of us. This effort improves consistency, enhances control over the data, and allows for more efficient collaboration and maintenance of our deliverables.


Throughout the year, I continued strengthening the tools and reports that support the Operations team’s performance and inventory management. The dashboard launched earlier this year is now part of their daily routine, providing visibility into case status and helping the team prioritize their workload more effectively. Although the dashboard still faces occasional issues due to delays in Cornerstone data updates, I continue monitoring its performance and collaborating with the teams involved to ensure accuracy and reliability of the information.

In parallel, I have been enhancing the Python report to better align with the Operations team’s evolving needs. Recently, I integrated new columns to improve data visualization and provide deeper insights, allowing the team to make faster and better-informed decisions. These improvements reflect my ongoing commitment to process optimization, accuracy, and continuous support for the Operations team.

Throughout the year, I continued to expand my use of Python to automate and optimize daily tasks. The macro I previously developed has proven highly reliable and continues to save considerable time by automatically generating Excel reports and minimizing manual errors.

Recently, I enhanced the macro by integrating new columns to provide better visualization for the Operations team and make the information easier to interpret. I also applied Python knowledge while working on SQL data transformations to replace ODL tables with SOR-based queries, ensuring continuity and consistency of data.

Additionally, I have been collaborating with my teammate to standardize our reports and automate parts of the process, allowing us to maintain a unified format and improve efficiency. These experiences have helped me strengthen my Python skills and apply them in practical, business-impacting scenarios.

I will continue to look for new opportunities to apply Python in other processes, aiming to further enhance efficiency, reduce manual work, and deliver more value to the Operations team.
