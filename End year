All my tasks continue to be supported by proper controls to minimize risks, including detailed logs that allow me to verify whether cases were created correctly and prevent potential errors. I maintain constant communication with the Operations team, who promptly notify me of any issues with merchants or CMs. This collaboration allows me to identify and address duplicate cases or other anomalies in a timely and effective manner.

In the second half of the year, I focused on ensuring business continuity as the ODL tables in our SQL environment are planned to be decommissioned. These tables are essential for providing data support to the Operations team. To mitigate the impact, I began developing new queries that extract information directly from the SOR tables, which are the main data sources feeding ODL. This proactive approach ensures that we can maintain the same level of service and data reliability once the ODL tables are retired.

Additionally, I have been working closely with my teammate to standardize the reports used by both of us. This effort improves consistency, enhances control over the data, and allows for more efficient collaboration and maintenance of our deliverables.


Throughout the year, I continued strengthening the tools and reports that support the Operations team’s performance and inventory management. The dashboard launched earlier this year is now part of their daily routine, providing visibility into case status and helping the team prioritize their workload more effectively. Although the dashboard still faces occasional issues due to delays in Cornerstone data updates, I continue monitoring its performance and collaborating with the teams involved to ensure accuracy and reliability of the information.

In parallel, I have been enhancing the Python report to better align with the Operations team’s evolving needs. Recently, I integrated new columns to improve data visualization and provide deeper insights, allowing the team to make faster and better-informed decisions. These improvements reflect my ongoing commitment to process optimization, accuracy, and continuous support for the Operations team.

Throughout the year, I continued to expand my use of Python to automate and optimize daily tasks. The macro I previously developed has proven highly reliable and continues to save considerable time by automatically generating Excel reports and minimizing manual errors.

Recently, I enhanced the macro by integrating new columns to provide better visualization for the Operations team and make the information easier to interpret. I also applied Python knowledge while working on SQL data transformations to replace ODL tables with SOR-based queries, ensuring continuity and consistency of data.

Additionally, I have been collaborating with my teammate to standardize our reports and automate parts of the process, allowing us to maintain a unified format and improve efficiency. These experiences have helped me strengthen my Python skills and apply them in practical, business-impacting scenarios.

I will continue to look for new opportunities to apply Python in other processes, aiming to further enhance efficiency, reduce manual work, and deliver more value to the Operations team.


Set the Agenda

Throughout the year, I continued to focus on improving visibility and efficiency for the Operations team. The Inventory Hygiene report and the dashboard we implemented earlier in the year remain key tools that help the teams monitor case status and take timely action. I also enhanced the Python reports to include new columns, making them more insightful and aligned with the team’s needs. These improvements helped strengthen operational control and ensure that the information provided remains accurate and actionable.

Bring others with you

Collaboration remains one of my top priorities. I worked closely with my teammate to standardize our reports, ensuring we both operate with a consistent format and approach. This not only improves the quality of our deliverables but also strengthens teamwork and mutual understanding. I continue to share Python knowledge and support colleagues whenever possible, especially when developing or adapting automated tools that can benefit the wider team.
In addition, I keep close collaboration with Operations and data teams, particularly as we prepare for the ODL decommissioning. Working together to transition to SOR tables ensures continuity and reinforces a strong sense of shared responsibility.

Do it the right way

Integrity and process reliability are central to my work. I remain vigilant about ensuring that all reports and queries follow proper controls and data validation steps. When issues arise—such as those related to data updates or automation reliability—I proactively address them, either by adjusting queries or creating manual backup solutions to maintain business continuity.

Recently, I also collaborated with other support teams to review and regulate access permissions for CCPs using GDM, ensuring that each user only has access to the markets they work with. This initiative strengthens data security and reinforces control measures across the process.

These actions reflect my commitment to doing things the right way and ensuring that Operations continues to receive accurate and dependable information without interruption.




Throughout the year, I consistently operated with a strong risk mindset and ensured all my activities were performed in full compliance with company policies and procedures. I maintain proper controls and validations across my tasks to minimize operational risk and guarantee data integrity.

I also take an active role in identifying potential risks and discussing them openly with my manager and partner teams, ensuring timely escalation and resolution when needed. My recent work reviewing GDM access permissions with other support teams and preparing for the ODL decommissioning reflects my commitment to safeguarding information and maintaining business continuity.

By adhering to Amex’s Code of Conduct and promoting responsible data management practices, I continue to contribute to a culture of integrity, accountability, and risk awareness.
