All my tasks continue to be supported by proper controls to minimize risks, including detailed logs that allow me to verify whether cases were created correctly and prevent potential errors. I maintain constant communication with the Operations team, who promptly notify me of any issues with merchants or CMs. This collaboration allows me to identify and address duplicate cases or other anomalies in a timely and effective manner.

In the second half of the year, I focused on ensuring business continuity as the ODL tables in our SQL environment are planned to be decommissioned. These tables are essential for providing data support to the Operations team. To mitigate the impact, I began developing new queries that extract information directly from the SOR tables, which are the main data sources feeding ODL. This proactive approach ensures that we can maintain the same level of service and data reliability once the ODL tables are retired.

Additionally, I have been working closely with my teammate to standardize the reports used by both of us. This effort improves consistency, enhances control over the data, and allows for more efficient collaboration and maintenance of our deliverables.
