Nicolas Cosso Leskovar is the leader of the Disputes team for Mexico. I work closely with him on a daily basis to manage the team’s inventory. Whenever he notices any variation in the inventory, he reaches out to me so we can identify the reason behind the increase or decrease. I also contact him whenever I have questions regarding case handling or specific situations within the team’s operations.


Nicolas is an excellent leader. He is always attentive to any changes in his inventory, which reflects his ability to make decisions quickly and effectively. He has a deep understanding of his process and manages his team with great skill and confidence. Currently, he is leading around 30 people, which is a strong example of his ability to bring others with him by guiding, supporting, and empowering his team to deliver results.

Nicolas does such an excellent job that I don’t see any particular area for improvement at this time. He is an experienced leader who already demonstrates strong command of his role and leads his team effectively.
