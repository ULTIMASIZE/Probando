Since February 2022, I have been supporting the Disputes Operations team by managing case inventory across multiple markets, ensuring accurate distribution of cases and availability of analyst profiles within the system. My role combines operational support with data analysis, working closely with Team Leaders to provide visibility into workload fluctuations, identify root causes for inventory changes, and ensure smooth day-to-day operations. I also design and maintain reporting solutions (SQL queries, Excel pivots, Python automations) that drive efficiency and support strategic decision-making.
