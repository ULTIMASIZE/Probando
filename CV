"In my first role at American Express, I joined the Disputes area in 2011 supporting the Canadian market. Within a year, I became a subject matter expert, managing complex cases and overseeing the market mailbox.

I played a key role in the migration of this process to another HUB, delivering trainings, facilitating On the Job Training sessions, and ensuring quality through feedback.

I later supported the IDC market, responsible for the issuance of physical letters and the handling of high-value disputes. I also led the migration of this process to GDM, collaborating with global teams and performing off-hours testing with India.

My Spanish and French skills allowed me to assist Mexico, Spain, and France, as well as to train new hires. I later managed the Argentina market transition into GDM and finally supported the GDC market, also characterized by high-value disputes.

Through these diverse market experiences, I built deep process knowledge, adaptability, and a track record of driving successful transitionsâ€”skills that laid the foundation for my current role."
