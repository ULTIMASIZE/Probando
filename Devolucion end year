This year I continued strengthening the partnership with the Operations team by delivering accurate and timely reporting that supports decision-making across markets. I enhanced the Inventory Hygiene and Mexico High Inventory dashboards, incorporating new visual elements and controls to improve visibility of critical cases. I also developed several Python automations that simplified manual tasks, saving time and reducing the risk of human error. In addition, I collaborated with support teams to review system access in GDM, ensuring compliance and process security. These initiatives contributed to greater efficiency, accuracy, and control within our daily operations.


Throughout the year I demonstrated the American Express Leadership Behaviors by taking ownership of my work and driving continuous improvement in key processes. I proactively identified opportunities to automate reports with Python and shared best practices with colleagues to enhance team efficiency. I collaborated across different teams and regions to ensure alignment and deliver accurate data to stakeholders. I also focused on “doing the right thing” by implementing stronger controls around GDM access and maintaining high data integrity standards. These actions reflect my commitment to lead with integrity, support others, and deliver results responsibly.


This year I strengthened my technical and analytical skills, especially in Python and data automation, which allowed me to improve the accuracy and efficiency of several reports. I learned the importance of adapting quickly to changing priorities and maintaining clear communication with cross-functional teams. Overall, I made solid progress toward becoming more data-driven and solution-oriented in my role.
