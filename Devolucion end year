Looking back at this year, I can honestly say it’s been one of the most complete and challenging years for me — but also one of the most rewarding. I’ve had the opportunity to keep growing both technically and professionally, while continuing to support the Operations team with the dashboards and reports that are part of their daily routine.

One of the highlights of the year was the launch of the Operations dashboard. Even though it’s still evolving and depends on data from Cornerstone — which sometimes causes delays or gaps — it’s been a great learning experience. I learned how to manage dependencies and find workarounds to make sure the team still gets reliable and timely information. It also helped me strengthen my problem-solving mindset and adapt to situations where things are not fully in my control.

Throughout the year, I continued improving the Python reports to make them more aligned with the team’s needs. I added new columns and refined the logic behind some calculations, which made the reports more intuitive and useful for the Operations leaders. That process helped me see how even small technical adjustments can have a big impact on efficiency.

I also had the chance to work more closely with other teams that support Operations — especially around topics like data access and controls. These collaborations helped me understand the importance of ensuring that each market and user only has the access they truly need. It gave me a broader perspective on risk management and the value of doing things the right way.

On a personal level, I think I’ve grown a lot in terms of ownership and independence. I’ve learned to manage my projects end-to-end, anticipate potential issues, and communicate proactively with stakeholders. I feel more confident not just executing tasks, but also proposing improvements and thinking strategically about where automation can bring the most value.

Overall, I see this year as a combination of technical progress, process improvement, and collaboration. And going forward, I really want to keep identifying opportunities to implement Python and automation in new areas, continue strengthening data accuracy and reporting, and support the team in working more efficiently.
